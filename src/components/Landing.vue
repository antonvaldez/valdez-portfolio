        <h3>Full Stack Web Developer</h3>
        <p>Iâ€™ve always enjoyed solving problems and building things, which eventually led me to discover web development. I started learning on my own, and the more I explored coding, the more I realized I wanted to do this full time. Coming from a different field, I decided to fully shift gears and join a bootcamp to focus on full stack development. Now, I'm all in on becoming a developer and excited to keep learning and building.</p>
